Title: Leaving Academia


Up until last November I was a physics graduate student studying experimental atomic physics. After three years of work in AMO I was unhappy. I decided to pursue a career in industry, and so far it seems like the best decision I've made in...three years. So in case anyone else is in the same boat I was, let me lay out my reasons for entering and leaving academia and how my life has changed since.

# What I liked about physics

I fell in love with physics while studying computer engineering. As part of my ECE major we were required to take a series of physics courses. During the intro electromagnetism course I decided I wanted to pursue physics full time. From that moment on my passion was discovering as much as I could about the world via the tools of physics. 

Electromagnetism was always my favorite subject within physics coursework, I could visualize the concepts vividly and more or less calculate whatever I wanted. I liked calculating things, and I liked programming simulations for particle collisions. During my undergrad career I worked for Prof. Rutherfoord at the University of Arizona doing particle simulations (very simple ones). I also did more experimental work with Prof. LeRoy in the realm of graphene. Graphene research was my first real experience with experimental research. It took months to prepare samples, and at the end of those months it took seconds to break those samples. I grew CVD graphene on copper, transfered it to silicon, used e-beam lithography to print tiny contacts on the graphene, and then if everything went to plan it would be looked at under an STM. I had samples break at every step of the way, and in the end had little to show for all the hard work. Still, it was fun to be doing "cutting-edge" research.

When I pictured grad school I pictured myself learning relativistic QFT and figuring out how nature worked even deeper. I pictured myself building experiments in the synchrotron at Cornell and doing particle physics. I also got interested in atomic physics, and it was the field I chose in the end. I knew very little about it, other than BECs seemed exotic and magical. My first foray into this field was taking over an entire lab more or less by myself working for Prof Vengalattore at Cornell. It was exciting making a MOT, setting up optical paths and aligning all the beams..the first time. I read everything I could about my field and became excited about the future.

# What I hated about research

Once the initial excitement over the new things I was learning died down, and I wasn't learning any longer, things changed. I was working for a professor who demanded long hours, whatever it took to get something done. His methodology was to keep at it until it worked, no time to consider what could be going wrong, just hard work. Initially I put in upwards of 60 hours a week in the lab because I was enjoying myself. I had a whole lab to play with, and fancy lasers to align and atoms to trap. After a few months had passed, though, I seemed to be doing the same thing every day: align mirrors, see that nothing worked, figure out what was broken, rinse repeat. This is the nature of science research, or my experience with it. It's a bit like running a marathon, you have to keep at it trying new things every day for months or years until one day things might work. For me the end result wasn't enough to justify the work. 

I thought that maybe it was just my professor at Cornell, and I believe he had a large part to play in my distaste for graduate research, but I decided to try a new professor in Boulder, Colorado. I worked for Cindy Regal, and she was much less demanding and overall a much better professor. I was happy to be working on something new and it was like starting all over again. I loved learning about the new experiment and all the facets it involved. I built a few laser setups, wrote some software to analyze data, took more graduate classes, and read papers. After awhile, though, it started to feel all too familiar: I was doing the same thing everyday to make something work. It was then that I decided to leave research.
